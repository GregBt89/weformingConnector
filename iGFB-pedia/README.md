Introduction to iGFBs
The landscape of electricity generation and consumption in the European Union is rapidly evolving. The swift adoption of wind and solar energy is leading to a more variable mix of power generation resources. Meanwhile, electric vehicle sales are surging and are expected to become a significant new load on the electrical grid. Substantial investments will be required to upgrade the aging transmission and distribution infrastructure to meet the electricity delivery needs of a modernized grid.
The increasing reliance on electricity will impose new demands on the power system. Additionally, many consumers are now generating or storing electricity on-site, leading to more frequent two-way power flows on the grid.
To address these challenges, a diverse and cost-effective portfolio of flexible resources will be essential. This portfolio will include a mix of generation, demand-side, and storage resources. The EU aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, necessitating a faster decarbonization of electricity generation across the EU.
One critical opportunity lies in better aligning electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings with the needs and resources of the grid. Buildings account for approximately 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and are responsible for over a third of the EU's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. For decades, targeted efforts have improved energy efficiency in these buildings, however the pace of change is rather slow. Additionally, the load of some buildings has been managed to reduce electric power use during peak demand times, when the grid is most stressed, expensive to operate, and often has the highest CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the total number of buildings participating in such schemes is negligible. 
There are further opportunities to better coordinate building electricity use, particularly by integrating the growing number of buildings equipped with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with grid conditions to address the evolving challenges on the power system. The adoption of new energy technologies by consumers will introduce opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of electricity consumption, benefiting both building owners and occupants, as well as the broader distribution system.
In this light, Intelligent Grid-Forming Buildings (iGFBs) are equipped with smart technologies that enable two-way communication between users and the electricity as well as heating “grid” (network). This facilitates the continuous optimization of energy use for grid services, occupant needs and preferences, climate mitigation, and cost reductions. iGFBs can play a crucial role in enhancing affordability and reliability across the EU power system. Moreover, they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions through lower overall energy use and increased demand flexibility, which aids in the integration of renewable generation. The contributions of iGFBs can be categorized into five areas: improving energy efficiency, shedding power load, shifting power load, modulating power load, and self-consuming through power generation using DERs.
iGFBs primarily offer economic value and autonomy directly to electricity and heating energy consumers. iGFB consumers have the information and means to lower their consumption when prices are high, ultimately resulting in lower bills. Essentially, they enable an economic strategy that aligns consumer behavior with the operational realities of electricity supply, promoting a more stable and efficient energy distribution system. From another perspective, iGFBs modernize, the well-known from the past, practice of electricity consumption during night, leveraging lower pricing due to reduced demand and the difficulty in rapidly adjusting electricity generation from base-load power plants. This practice, reflected in time-of-use tariffs, incentivized consumers to shift their usage, optimizing grid efficiency, reducing waste, and lowering individual energy bills. Nowadays this practice needs to be adapted to a much more multidimensional energy landscape.
