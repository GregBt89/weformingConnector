## Introduction to iGFBs

The landscape of electricity generation and consumption in the European Union is rapidly evolving. The adoption of wind and solar energy has led to a more variable energy mix, while electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a major new load on the electrical grid. At the same time, substantial upgrades to aging infrastructure are necessary to meet modern electricity demands.

Consumers are increasingly generating or storing electricity on-site, creating a two-way power flow on the grid. To meet future needs, the EU must deploy a cost-effective, flexible mix of generation, demand-side, and storage resources. The EU’s climate goals — a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 — demand a rapid decarbonization of electricity generation.

Buildings, which represent ~40% of the EU’s total energy consumption and over one-third of energy-related GHG emissions, present a key opportunity. Although progress has been made in improving energy efficiency, the uptake of demand-response capabilities and distributed energy resources (DERs) remains limited.

### Why Do We Need iGFBs: Social, Economic, and Technological Importance

Intelligent Grid-Forming Buildings (iGFBs) are equipped with smart technologies enabling two-way communication with the energy grid. This allows dynamic energy optimization for:

- Grid services  
- Occupant comfort and preferences  
- Climate mitigation  
- Cost reduction  

By improving energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and integration of renewables, iGFBs can lower emissions and operational costs while improving grid reliability and affordability.

iGFBs create value for energy consumers by:

- Reducing costs via time-sensitive consumption  
- Increasing autonomy through onsite generation and storage  
- Supporting broader grid stability and efficiency  
- Enhancing the utility of time-of-use tariffs in a modern energy landscape  

### Examples of Existing iGFBs

Examples will be explored in the [Integration](#igfb-integration) section, including pilot projects across Luxembourg, Portugal, Croatia, Belgium, Spain, Germany, and a cross-pilot interoperability demonstration.
